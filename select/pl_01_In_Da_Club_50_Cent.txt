Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party
like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi
like it's your birthday
And you know
we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
When I pull out up front
you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep
it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre
now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem
and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothin' change
hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt
that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch
how I move you'll mistake me
for a playa or pim
Been hit wit' a few shells
but I dont walk wit' a limp
In the hood then the ladies
sayin' 50 you hot
They like me
I want them to love me
like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them
niggas'll tell ya im loco
And the plan is
to put the rap game
in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man
my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal
and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said
she feelin' my style
she feelin' my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi
and they ready to go (Okay)
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
My flow, my show
brought me  the doe
That bought me all
my fancy things
My crib, my cars
my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I done came up
and I ain't change
And you should love it
way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad I thought
that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar
toastin' to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga
tryin' to pull me back right
When my junk get to pumpin
in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch
if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire
let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money homie
I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me
cause go 'head switch
the style up
If the niggas hate
then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside
there wit 'a bottle of bub
You know where we fuckin' be
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X
if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex
I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
if you into gettin' rubbed
Don't try to act
like you ain't know where
we've been either nigga
In the club all the time nigga
it's about to pop off nigga
